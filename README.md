## Dear Mojang,

Lax1dude is one of the developers of a project that has recently become a large target of your DMCA team, the project in question is "Eaglercraft" which is a series of full HTML5/JavaScript ports of Minecraft Java Edition's source code that run on all major browsers and are fully compatible with all existing Minecraft multiplayer infrastructure.

Eagtek (the developers) are not interested in fighting your DMCA complaints, neither are they affiliated with any sites still providing the infringing files, they are simply interested in preserving the project even if that does mean first completely removing every open source copy of the project off of the internet via DMCA.

The game runs smoothly even on low end hardware, like Chromebooks, and they believe your developer team may be interested in taking a look at our code and potentially adopting the source of the project for official use on Minecraft.net as a paid web client once these DMCA complaints are resolved.

Eagtek are hoping you can assist them in getting in contact with an active Mojang representative, the Eaglercraft creator's inbox for this specific subject is eagsforum [at] gmail [dot] com if you could forward this contact information and these links to the Java Edition developer team it would be much appreciated.

The goal of eaglercraft was never to pirate the game, it was just to port it to the browser, and the years of time and effort put into the port should not be killed off so violently. we ask that you contact us at the email above to talk things out and figure out a future for eagler. Thank you for reading <3

## My Note,

I am the developer of NostalgiaCraft, I am 15 and in 9th grade on my way to my early programming career... Mojang... please consider the request of Lax1dude? He even said in his statement he did not want to pirate the game in the first place. This project has been the training ground for me to learn a bit more about Java and mapping and honestly may even be a great opportunity to encourage young developers like me to start off with something new! 
Please Mojang... there is no need to be biased, please talk to your fans about a potential solution to the problem instead of adding more fuel to the fire!
Thanks to anyone who reads this.
